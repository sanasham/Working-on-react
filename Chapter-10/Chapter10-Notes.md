tailwind css:
=============

css
scss


The look part of the app - CSS

Why frameworks - optimized css, consistent UI and saves time.

Eg : MaterialUI, Bootstrap, Base Web UI, Ant design, chakra UI

Can we use more than one framework ? - It's all package can use any number of frameworks, not consistent way.

Ways to write css :
Native CSS - all components's styles in a single file index.css
SCSS - Syntactical CSS - it is then converted to css
Inline - style attribute - pass object - {{backgroundColor : "red"}}
Component Library - MaterialUI, Bootstrap, Base Web UI, Ant design, chakra UI
CSS Framework - Tailwind
styled-components ---this is one more way -- this is commonly used in react projects
Pros : consistent UI save time

Cons : Bundle size - Loose control over design personal customizition is hard

Tailwind CSS:

css on the go (in the same file )
reusablity
it has prebuilt class
less bundle size (minimal css) only includes the css classes that we have used
Flexible UI (Customize)

--- it has very good documentation

--------------------------------------------
how we can inject tailwind css into our project
1) using CDN  --- we have to place this script tag in index.html file
2)


3 type devices
-------------
1)small device  - mobile
2) medium device - tablet
3) large device - laptop

pros:
code is less
no duplicate css
bundle size less
easy to debug
faster developement
we can customize if we need


cons: too much class, long class have to write.
it makes classnames looks ugly as it is too long
it is hard to learn new developers
